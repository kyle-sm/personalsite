# Flask Website

My personal website written in Python with Flask. I wanted more hands-on
experience with this sort of thing, so I got this set up. It relies on Google
Cloud Services, in particular Firestore. Designed to be hosted in Google App
Engine, but hypothetically could be hosted locally. The application to make
posts is separate.
